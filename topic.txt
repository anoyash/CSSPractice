understanding position absolute and relative

        1. Absolute : as soon as we make the position absolute it comes above in 3-D spatial.
        2. If multiple elements are in sequence and we do position absolute , it will come in layer 1 , layer 2 and layer 3
           where layer 1 belongs to element 1 and so on.
           so, height of layer 3 > layer 2 > layer 1
        3. Jiske element ke andar rakhna hai, make the element CSS property position : relative 
           and jisko andar rakhna hai , make that elements CSS property position : absolute

        4. Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 
           However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first.
           They also work differently depending on the position value.

        5. Types of position : fixed , relative , absolute , sticky , static

    4. If we set the CSS propery display : flex . Then the children displayed inside the element displayed in 
    the horizontal manner
