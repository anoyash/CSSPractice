--> Understanding Units
    - px            : pixels are always fixed
    - %             : percentage of the parent container 
    - vw , vh       : vw : (view port width) , vh : (view port height) : [ based on the screen size ] 
    - vmax , vmin   : view port maximum and view port minimum 
                    {
                        * In respect to Desktop my width is more 
                        * In respect to Phone my height is more
                        * One interestion point , for eg , we have given width as 7vmax and we start to reduce
                        the screen width, at a certain point width becomes lesser than height, then further
                        reduction in width from that point does not affect the size of object. To see the
                        effect we need to further reduce the height 
                    } 
    - em, rem       : em : element measurement and rem : root element measurement ( mostly <html> )
                    {
                        em : relative to font-size of the parent element
                        rem : relative to font-size of the root elementary (Usually html )
                        For eg : if font-size of parent is : 16px
                        then, 1 em = 16px and 2px = 32px and so on 
                    } 

--> Layout of the website
    - absolute vs flex
    - Try to minimise the use of absolute position
    - display flex 
    - {
        display-wrap : wrap; 
        flex-direction : column; 
      }

--> Flexbox
    - Display flex
    - Aligning items in x and y axis
    - flex direction
    - flex wrap

--> CSS media queries
    - Used to create different behaviour based on our screen size


Key points to keep in mind to make website responsive

1. CSS Flexbox
2. CSS Units
3. Responsive typography
4. Mobile-First Approach : Always think about how it will look when seen in mobile 
5. Flexible Images and Media
